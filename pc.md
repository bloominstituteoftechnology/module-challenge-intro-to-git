## Research Questions

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System. Helps in a variety of ways when building a website. Lets many developers work together to build or fix stuff from the website all at the same time. Allows the main to be accessed by all.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based git hosting service that lets your manage git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? To be able to make a copy of the main and work freely without worrying about ruining it. Also to have many people work on the main.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout _branch_
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch : download all changes from remote but don't integrate into head. git merge : merge branch into your current head. git pull : download changes and directly merge into head.
7. What is a merge conflict? When competing changed are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Best way is to go in the file and make the changes it needs.
