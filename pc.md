## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is the most popular distriubted version control system. VCSs let developers collaborate on projects and have a consistent timeline of changes made to the project
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Github is a hub for Git. It hosts repositories and gives developers a central hub to share, create, and collaborate on projects.
3. Why do we create a branch? We create a branch so we do not mess up the main trunk of code. If we want to test something new, add new code, fix bugs, we can test on our own copy of the code so if we make a mistake it wont affect the main trunk of code
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout -b
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch is a command that fetches updates from the remote repository to update the local repository
git merge merges various branches of code together to combine into one branch
git pull combines both merge and fetch together for an efficient line of code. pullng all of the past changes and merging all branches into one branch
7. What is a merge conflict? when trying to merge two branches, if two lines of code aren't compatible, you will recieve a merge conflict
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Comparing the conflicting lines of code and fixing them
