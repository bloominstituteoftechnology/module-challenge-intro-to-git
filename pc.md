## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
    Git is a distributed version control system that monitors and controls code changes throughout development across serveral people or teams.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
    Git is the language that we use control the system itself, and GutHub is a website that hosts and manages repositories for sharing and saving repos externally off the developer's local machine, execute rollbacks, see changes and who did what to a project.
3. Why do we create a branch?
    Creating a branch allows for the developer to work with existing code in a new space that will not affect existing code. Generally, creating a branch is for security purposes so as not to overwrite, delete, or break existing code that has been pushed.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
    A pull request begins the process of merging new code with an existing main repository. The developer can tell others about the changes they've pushed to a branch in a repo.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
    For this example the cmd would be: git checkout main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
    git fetch retrieves the latest data from the remote repo but does not transfer any files, git merge adopts the proposed changes to the main repo, git pull actually downloads the changes from the repo and applies the changes locally.
7. What is a merge conflict?
    Can happen when multiple commits are unable to be merged due to more than one developer working on the code. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
    Pull the changes to your local repo and fix there. Developers can accept the remote version by file or for all conflicting files, or review the changes individually.
