## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch?
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

1.Git is a programming language used to upload code from local to public storage 
2.Git is a set of commands while GitHub is a server that storages code 
3.So we don't push our code with the main branch, creating problems for other students/Co workers 
4.to review code and add it to the main branch 
5.git checkout branch-name 
6."git pull" automatically merges changes on your local repository while "git fetch" lets you review the change and needs to be manually merged with "git merge" . Basically git fetch + git merge =git pull 
7. A merge Conflict is when the same line of code has been changed in two different branches and merged together. git doesn't know what to do with information that exists in the same space 
8.There are three ways to resolve a merge conflict. "Accept Current Change" , "Accept Incoming Change." "Accept Both Changes." you want to "compare changes" to figure out which change is the correct choice.
