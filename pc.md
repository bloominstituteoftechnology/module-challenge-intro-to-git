## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?git is for cloning and saving changes to repositories
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? github hosts repos
3. Why do we create a branch? to keep our changes separate until we are ready to merge them
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? to request them to view the differences and merge if ready
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? fetch lets you see what other people are working on, git merge will merge your branch with the master branch, git pull allows you to update a local repo from a remote location
7. What is a merge conflict? when two branches make edits to the same line in a file and it cannot resolve it automatically
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? I would use the mergetool command and go through each conflict and then add and commit
