## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
- Git is a software that allows you to navigate your file directories as well as communicate with git hosting services which allow you to easily collaborate with other developers on the same projects.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
- Github is a Git hosting service that allows collaborating developers to exchange and propose changes and updates to their projects, whereas Git is the software that allows them to bring the group code down locally and edit it, then to send back up to Github for the group to use and evaluate.
3. Why do we create a branch?
- Creating branches allows us to be specific and to isolate our changes from the master, as not to interfere.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
- Pull requests are to let the other collaborators know of and see your changes to the code.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
- You can use the command git checkout [desired-branch] to switch between branches
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
- git merge does a load of commits by merging branches together. git fetch downloads the new data from your remote repository without interfering with any of your files. git pull fetches and merges together meaning that it brings in the new data while also merging or combining it with your own local work.
7. What is a merge conflict?
- When you merge branches that have competing commits within them, you get a merge conflict.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
To reslove it, you have to manually edit the file and decide which commits you want to keep and which to discard.
