## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? an open source distributed version control system.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?github is cloud base open source that lets you manage Git repositories, git is a version control that lets you manage and keep track of your code history.
3. Why do we create a branch? use git checkout -b
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? Allows the user to review and decide if they'd like to merge the repositories.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. cd ..
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?git fetch is similar to pull but doesn't merge. i.e. it fetches remote updates ( refs and objects ) but your local stays the same (i.e. origin/master gets updated but master stays the same) . git pull pulls down from a remote and instantly merges. git clone clones a repo.
7. What is a merge conflict? When certain info have conflicting data on the same line.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Open the file and remove all conflicted text.
