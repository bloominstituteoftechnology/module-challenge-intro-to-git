## Research Questions

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?

- Git is an open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

- GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

3. Why do we create a branch?

- It allows you to isolate your changes from the master branch (an independent line of development).

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?

- It's used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.

- Git Checkout

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?

- The git fetch: this command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.
- The git merge: this command will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history (combine branches).
- The git pull: this command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.

7. What is a merge conflict?

- Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

- To resolve a merge conflict, you must manually edit the conflicted file to select the changes that you want to keep in the final merge.
