## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? 
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? 
3. Why do we create a branch? 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? 
7. What is a merge conflict? 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

1. Git is the open source sea of code used by developers.
2. GitHub is the for profit company that lets people do stuff efficiently.
3. Because it allows us to isolate our code and experiment freely.
4. Peer review before final implementation.
5. git checkout -b
6. Fetch pulls commits and progress from a remote repository so you can compare code. Merge takes forked  work and recombines it back to one whole thing. Pull brings together a remote repository and immediately updates the local to match it.
7. Merge conflict occurs when multiple people alter the same lines in a code in a way that Git can't automatically resolve.
8. Removing the conflicting parts of what is trying to merge and editing and resubmitting the merge.
