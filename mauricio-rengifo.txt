            4. Go to the botton "Copy" (shoul be green) and copy the URL under HTTPS, save it, you will need it later.
            5. go do your terminal and locate yourself inside the folder where you wanna copy those files
            6. write in the comman like "git clone url-that-you-just-copy" and press enter
            7. if its your first time will ask you for your github login info, just write it!

            12.then use "git push -u origin nameOfYourBranch" to submit everything to github
            13.then go to the github folder that you fork, your version not the original, and go to "pull request" and create one
