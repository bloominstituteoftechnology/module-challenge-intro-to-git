## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
//Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
//"Git is an open-source tool developers install locally to manage source code, while GitHub is an online service to which developers who use Git can connect and upload or download resources."

3. Why do we create a branch?
// To avoid damaging any previous work done but still be able to work off of previous code.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
//To compare your branch to the main branch

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
//git switch main or git switch anne-hickman

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. 
What does each command do?
// git fetch = git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.
//git merge = putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
//git pull = used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.

7. What is a merge conflict?
//an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
//manually resolve it using git rebase. Rebasing is used to integrate changes from one branch into another to resolve conflicts when multiple commits happen on the same file.
