## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. 
3. Why do we create a branch? 
For when working on new features or bug fixes on the code because it isolates your work from other team members.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. 
git checkout
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch: downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.
git merge: lets you take the independent lines of development created by a git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
git pull: used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
7. What is a merge conflict?
When Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Go over your conflicts in the code and choose which ones to keep then push and merge again.
