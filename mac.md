## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
git is a tool used to store code and allow programmers to work collaboratively

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
git keeps track of changes made to your code. Github stores different versions of your code.

3. Why do we create a branch? 
One way is to type "git chceckout -b branchName"

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
A pull request allows you to merge the code changes you have made to the main repository

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git checkout

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch allows you to see all of the changes made in your remote repository. git merge allows you to integrate changes made on one branch to another branch. git pull allows you to fetch and integrate from another repository or local branch.

7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict happens when git is unable to resolve differences between two commits. This usually happens when multiple commits change the same line of code

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
to resolve a merge conflict, decide on which changes to keep then make a new commit.
