## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
    A repository (repo) that tracks all changes made in a project.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
    Github is the company that hosts several repositories. A 'git' is a single repository.
    
3. Why do we create a branch? 
    We create a branch so that we can work on new features or fix bugs independently. Branches can be merged.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
    It updates the local version of a repo from a remote version.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
    git checkout

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
    'git fetch' downloads all changes from a remote repo, but does not integrate them
    'git merge' integrates available changes from a remote repo, but does not download new changes
    'git pull' downloads and integrates all changes from a remote repo
   
7. What is a merge conflict?
    A merge conflict happens when there are conflicting changes to the same line of code and GitHub is unable to resolve the differences. 

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
    If Git detects a conflict, it will highlight the conflicted area and ask which code you wish to keep.
