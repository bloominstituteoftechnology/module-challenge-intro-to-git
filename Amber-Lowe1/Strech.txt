STRECH GOALS COMPLETED

 1   Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console.

- 2    Research and setup SSH keys with Github, so that you do not need to input your username/password each time you push.

 - [ ] Reseach the Git commands `reset `, `revert`, `clean`.
    These commands will allow you to go back and ammends previous commits you have made.

 Reseach the Git commands `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`.

    These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the master branch.

 - [ ] Research and understand what a `merge conflict` is and how to resolve it.

1         Generating a new SSH key
Open Git Bash.

Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.

> Generating public/private rsa key pair.
When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

> Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa):[Press enter]
At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases".

> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent
Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key.
If you have GitHub Desktop installed, you can use it to clone repositories and not deal with SSH keys. It also comes with the Git Bash tool, which is the preferred way of running git commands on Windows.

Ensure the ssh-agent is running:

If you are using the Git Shell that's installed with GitHub Desktop, the ssh-agent should be running.
If you are using another terminal prompt, such as Git for Windows, you can use the "Auto-launching the ssh-agent" instructions in "Working with SSH key passphrases", or start it manually:

# start the ssh-agent in the background
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
> Agent pid 59566
Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Add the SSH key to your GitHub account.
______________________________________________________
To test if SSH over the HTTPS port is possible, run this SSH command:

$ ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com
> Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
> provide shell access.
