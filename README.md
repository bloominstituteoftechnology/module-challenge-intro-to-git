# Git for Web Development Project

Welcome to Day 1 at BloomTech! Today we are going to spend some time setting up your computer and learning the tools that you will be using to complete this program. Just like your first day at a dev job, you will need to get your environment set up to build and run your code. Before you are able to complete any of these steps, you will need to install all [required programs](https://www.notion.so/bloomtech/4da087ea26dd441bbc8030198811150d?v=5c67662450d14d64b0b2b6d32b841fee) then set up your SSH key and attach it to your GitHub account. For the SSH key, please watch the video on the [BloomTech Git Workflow](https://bloomtech.notion.site/bloomtech/BloomTech-Git-Flow-Step-by-step-269f68ae3bf64eb689a8328715a179f9) to see how to do that.

Complete the set up tasks and then get started on the research questions found inside the repository. If you are using a Windows machine, please complete the `pc.md` file, if you are using Mac or Linux please complete `mac.md`.

## Task 1: MVP
You will need to follow the [BloomTech Git Workflow](https://bloomtech.notion.site/bloomtech/BloomTech-Git-Flow-Step-by-step-269f68ae3bf64eb689a8328715a179f9) to add a file to this project follow the steps below:

- [ ] Create your own version of this repo using the fork button at the top right of the repository
- [ ] Clone this repo by clicking the green Code button, then copy pasting the SSH URL: `git clone git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/Git-for-Web-Development-Project.git`
- [ ] Create a branch: `git checkout -b 'FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME'`
- [ ] Answer the questions in the `mac.md` or `pc.md` file, depending on which operating system you are using.
- [ ] Follow the steps for adding, committing, and pushing your work from your local computer to GitHub: 1. `git add FILE-NAME` 2. `git commit -m 'WRITE A MESSAGE TO DESCRIBE YOUR CHANGES HERE'` 3. `git push -u origin FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME`
- [ ] Create a Pull Request to submit your work. Reference the [BloomTech Git Workflow](https://bloomtech.notion.site/bloomtech/BloomTech-Git-Flow-Step-by-step-269f68ae3bf64eb689a8328715a179f9) for help with this.
- [ ] Make sure that your repository's main branch is listed on the left side of the screen and your repository's FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch is listed on the right side. This is telling GitHub that you want to compare the work you did in your FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch to the work in your main branch. Make sure that you don't click the "merge" button!

## Submission Instructions 

Please submit your project via Canvas by following [these instructions](https://bloomtech.notion.site/BloomTech-Git-Flow-Step-by-step-269f68ae3bf64eb689a8328715a179f9). See part 1, "Submitting an Assignment Without CodeGrade." You will need to submit your Pull Request URL in Canvas to turn in today's assignment.
