# Git for Web Development Project
In this project you will be using the concepts learned in the Git for Web Development lesson to fork/clone/push/and submit a PR for each project during this sprint.
WEB22
This project consists of two parts:

## Part One:
You will need to follow the Lambda School Git Workflow to add a file to this project follow the steps below:

- [ x] Create your own version of this repo - Fork
- [ x] Add your PM as a collaborator
- [x ] Clone this repo
- [x ] Create a branch `git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'`
  - [ x] Add a file to the project called `yourFirstName-yourLastName`.txt. This file can contain anything.
  - [x ] Run your usual git commands for adding/commiting and pushing **Be sure to push to your branch!**
- [ x] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  - [ x] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> master).
  - [ x] Add your PM as a reviewer on the Pull-Request
- [ x] PM then will count the Assignment as done by merging the HW back into master "STUDENT FORK".

## Part Two:
Go back and follow the same steps for your [UI-III-Flexbox project](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/UI-III-Flexbox) and your [User Interface - Great Idea Project](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/User-Interface).

In order to do this, you **do not** need to create new forks of these projects. Follow the steps below for each project:

- [x ] Add your PM as a collaborator to your fork. 
- [x ] Go into your project folder, make a new branch `firstname-lastname`
- [x ] Add your first and last name to the README.md file in the project and save.
- [ x] add/commit/and push to your own branch  **Be sure to push to your branch!**
- [ x] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  - [ x] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> master).
  - [x ] Add your PM as a reviewer on the Pull-Request
- [x ] PM then will count the Assignment as done by merging the HW back into master "STUDENT FORK".

## Stretch
- [x ] While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. Independantly research the following topics to learn more about Git.
  - [ x] Research and understand what a `merge conflict` is and how to resolve it.
  Caused by 2 competing lines of code from 2 different branches. Resolve in terminal, see git help for commands/steps.
  - [x ] Reseach the Git commands `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the master branch.
  pull: Used to DL and integrate remote changes. The target is always the currently checkedout HEAD branch. By default, pull uses a merge operation, but can be configured to use rebase instead.
  rebase: Integrates changes from one branch into another. Alternative to merge. Differs from merge by rewriting the commit history in order to produce a straight, linear succession of commits.
  merge: Used to intefrate changes from another branch. The target of this integration is always the currently checked out branch.
  - [x ] Reseach the Git commands `reset `, `revert`, `clean`. These commands will allow you to go back and ammends previous commits you have made.
  reset: Several sub commands go along with reset, but essential it allows you to change back to a previous commit. See Git Documentation
  revert: Used for undoing changes to a repository's commit history. 
  clean: Removes ignored directories, ignored files, and non-ignored files. See Git documentation.

- [x ] Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console. 

- [ x] Research and setup SSH keys with Github, so that you do not need to input your username/password each time you push.
