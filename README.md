# Git for Web Development Project
In this project you will be using the concepts learned in the Git for Web Development lesson to fork/clone/push/and submit a PR for each project during this sprint.

This project consists of two parts:

## Task 1: Set up Project
You will need to follow the Lambda School Git Workflow to add a file to this project follow the steps below:

- [X] Create your own version of this repo - Fork
- [X] Add your TL as a collaborator
- [X] Clone this repo
- [X] Create a branch `git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'`
  - [X] Add a file to the project called `yourFirstName-yourLastName`.txt. This should contain the link to your completed codepen from part 2 as well as the review questions/answers
  - [ ] Run your usual git commands for adding/committing and pushing **Be sure to push to your branch!**
- [ ] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  - [ ] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> main).
  - [ ] Add your TL as a reviewer on the Pull-Request
- [ ] TL then will count the Assignment as done by merging the HW back into main "STUDENT FORK".

## Task 2: MVP
1. fork this codepen https://codepen.io/BritHemming/pen/eYYEoPa?editors=1100
2. You will be marking up all of the HTML and styling it to look like this: https://codepen.io/BritHemming/full/jONmxOm using CSS
* this should be review from yesterday/ extra practice
3. After you are finished please copy the review questions into your .txt file and answer them
4. don't forget to add, commit and push your changes.

## Task 2b: Exit Ticket

Once you begin, you will have 15 minutes to answer the questions [here](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/M94mbzuHGQoMg6F3e/w9GqZYCQ2YoZZf).

The completion of these questions is mandatory for MVP. However, passing the quiz doesn't affect your standing as a Lambda School student whatsoever. This is Lambda School testing itself! Please answer honestly and to the best of your ability without using external references.

## Task 3: Stretch
Stretch Review questions: 
    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    -Inline elements go inside block elements, block elements make up their own space as inline goes inside of block tags. 
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    -Absolute or a fixed element is sticly positioned and will not budge from other content unless properties are changed. 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
     -By applying the box model rule to the element
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
      1.) <section><div><p>
      2.) <span> ?
      3.) <div><p></p></div>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    -The box model is important because it follows all the five spacing properties: height, width, margin, padding, and border. Its good practice to master spacing within a webpage.

Stretch Git Tasks
- [X] While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. Independently research the following topics to learn more about Git.
  - [X] Research and understand what a `merge conflict` is and how to resolve it.
  - [X] Research the Git commands `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the main branch.
  - [X] Research the Git commands `reset `, `revert`, `clean`. These commands will allow you to go back and amends previous commits you have made.

- [X] Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console. 

- [X] Research and setup SSH keys with GitHub, so that you do not need to input your username/password each time you push.
