Review questions and answers:
1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
	
	An block element takes up the full line and width it is given, whereas an inline element will not force a 		new line and will display inline with the content around it.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
	
	The element will be positioned reletively to it's nearest parent unless it has no parents in which case it 		will use the document body.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
	
	Setting the element in a <div> will allow you to do this, or you could set the element to display: block;.

4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element         that is display inline-block by default.
	Default Block:
		<div>
		<p>
		<ol>
	Default inline:
		<span>
		<br>
	Default inline-block:
		<button>
		
5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
	
	The box model is a way of remembering what properties change what parts of an element. It is 		represented as a layered series of "boxes" around an element. With padding the innermost, border the 		middle, and margin on the outside.

	The fix for the box model is called box-sizing: border-box. It tells the browser to include padding and 		borders in an element's width. You use it by inserting the command in your linked stylesheet.
